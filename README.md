# zapy

Run Zed Attack Proxy from command line

## pre-requisites

* ZAP must be running on the same host you're running this script on
* Java (for ZAP)
* Several python packages, do a ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## run (show help)

```
./zapy.py -h
```

### run spider only

```
./zapy.py -t http://127.0.0.1 -s
```

### run attack + spider 

```
./zapy.py -t http://127.0.0.1 -s -a 
```

### run attack + spider + create html report 

```
./zapy.py -t http://127.0.0.1 -s -a --html-report /data/scan-report.html 
```

If a report already exists, the script will not generate the report, re-run with:

```
./zapy.py -t http://127.0.0.1 -s -a --html-report /data/scan-report.html --force 
```

### set the api key

```
./zapy.py -t http://127.0.0.1 --spider --active-scan --html-report /data/scan-report.html --force --api-key aaabbbccddeeffgghh332211 
```

## spider

spidering now works, use ```-s``` to run the spider against ```TARGET```

## attack

this is now working, use ```-a``` to launch an attack against ```TARGET```

## basic auth

you're now able to configure basic auth to a target by setting 

```--auth``` 

this will require you to also specify 

```--authuser``` (the user you want to authenticate with) 

and 

```--authpass``` (the password for that user)

*Only for HTTP Basic Authentication is currently working*


## html reports

use ```--html-report /path/to/report.html``` to create a report in /path/to

## docker

#### create your own docker file using OWASP's weekly as base

```
docker build -t me/zap:latest .
```

####Â run it

docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/data me/zap python /zapy/zapy.py \
    -t http://172.17.0.10 \
    -s \
    --start \
    -k zap \
    --html-report /data/report.html

## todo

- add ability to install plugins into /opt/zap/plugins (once api supports this)
- add ability to only run a specific scan against a target or url 
- maybe run fuzzer against a specific url (?)
